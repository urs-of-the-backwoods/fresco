# fresco

fresco is a library to enable multi-language, multi-paradigm programming. It consists of multiple components, 
the intonaco part provides the runtime of the library. The sinopia part is a toolset to provide an underlying 
data structure to multiple languages, which can be used in different parts of the later program. The naming 
is originating in the fresco techniques, the intonaco is the last fresh layer of plaster, which intermix with the 
colour pigments, the sinophia is a first scetch of the final picture in monochrome paint.
